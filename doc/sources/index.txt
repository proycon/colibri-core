Introduction
===================


Colibri Core is a set of tools as well as a C++ and Python library for working with basic linguistic constructions such as n-grams and skipgrams (i.e patterns with one or more gaps, either of fixed or dynamic size) in a quick and memory-efficient way. At the core is the tool ``colibri-patternmodeller`` which allows you to build, view, manipulate and query pattern models.

The Colibri software is developed in the scope of the Ph.D. research project **Constructions as Linguistic Bridges**. This research examines the identification and extraction of aligned constructions or patterns across natural languages, and the usage of such constructions in Machine Translation. The aligned constructions are not identified on the basis of an extensive and explicitly defined grammar or expert database of linguistic knowledge, but rather are implicitly distilled from large amounts of example data. Our notion of constructions is broad and transcends the idea of words or variable-length phrases.

This documentation will illustrate how to work with the various tools and the library of colibri, as well as elaborate on the implementation of certain key aspects of the software.

Installation
===============

Colibri is hosted on `github <http://github.com/proycon/colibri-core/>`_ and should be retrieved through the versioning control system ``git``. Provided git is installed on your system, this is done as follows::

	$ git clone http://github.com/proycon/colibri-core.git
	
You need to compile the software, if you want FoLiA support you will need to first to install the following dependency:

 * **libfolia**; obtainable from `the FoLiA website <http://proycon.github.com/folia>`_,  follow the instructions included with libfolia to install it.

In addition to the C/C++ compiler (``gcc``), the build process for colibri makes use of ``autoconf`` and ``automake``. Make sure these are installed on your system. Also install the package ``autoconf-archive`` if available on your distribution. Colibri can now be compiled and installed::

  $ cd colibri
  $ bash bootstrap
  $ ./configure [--with-libfolia=/path/to/libfolia]
  $ make
  $ make install
  
You can optionally pass a prefix if you want to install colibri in a different location::

  $ ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/
  
 
Keeping colibri up to date
-----------------------------

Colibri is always under heavy development. Update your colibri copy by issuing a git pull::

 $ git pull
 
And then recompile as per the above instructions.

General usage instructions
---------------------------------

Colibri consist of various programs, each of which will output an extensive overview of available parameters if the parameter ``-h`` is passed. Each program is designed for a specialised purpose, with specific input and output formats. It is often needed to call multiple programs in succession to obtain the final analysis or model you desire. 

Corpus Class Encoding
================================

Introduction
----------------------

Computation on large datasets begs for solutions to keep memory consumption
manageable. Colibri requires that input corpora are converted into a compressed
binary form. In this form each word-type in the corpus is represented by a
numeric class. Highly frequent word-types get assigned low class numbers and
less frequent word-types get higher class numbers. The class is represented in
a dynamic-width byte-array, rather than a fixed-width integer.Patterns are
encoded per word, each word starts with a size marker of one byte indicating the number of bytes
are used for that word. The specified number of bytes that follow encode the
word class. Instead of a size marker, byte values of 128 and above are reserved for special markers,
such as encoding gaps and structural data. Finally, the pattern as a whole is
ended by a null byte.

All internal computations of all tools in colibri proceed on this internal
representation rather than actual textual strings, keeping running time shorter
and memory footprint significantly smaller.

Class-encoding your corpus
-----------------------------------

When working with colibri, you first want to **class encode** your corpus. This is done by the program ``colibri-classencode``. It takes as input a *tokenised* monolingual corpus in plain text format, containing *one sentence per line*. Each line should be delimited by a single newline character (unix line endings). Colibri is completely agnostic when it comes to the character encoding of the input. Given a corpus file ``yourcorpus``, class encoding is done as follows::

	$ colibri-classencode yourcorpus

This results in two files:

 * ``yourcorpus.colibri.cls`` - This is the class file; it lists all word-types and class numbers.  
 * ``yourcorpus.colibri.dat`` - This is the corpus is encoded binary form. It is a lossless compression that is roughly half the size of the original  

If your corpus is not tokenised yet, you can consider using the tokeniser `ucto <http://ilk.uvt.nl/ucto>`_ (not part of colibri), this will also do sentence detection and output one line per sentence::

	$ ucto -L en -n untokenisedcorpus.txt > tokenisedcorpus.txt
	
The above sample is for English (``-L en``), several other languages are also supported.

In addition to this plain text input. The class encoder also supports *FoLiA XML* (`folia website <http://proycon.github.com/folia>`_) if you compiled with FoLiA support, make sure such files end with the extension ``xml`` and they will be automatically interpreted as FoLiA XML::

	$ colibri-classencode yourcorpus.xml
	

It is possible to encode multiple corpus files similtaneously, but generating a joined class file::

	$ colibri-classencode yourcorpus1 yourcorpus2
	
This results in ``yourcorpus1.colibri.cls`` and ``yourcorpus1.colibri.dat`` and ``yourcorpus2.colibri.dat``. The class file spans both despite the name. An explicit name can be passed with the ``-o`` flag. It is also possible to encode multiple corpora in a single unified file by passing the ``-u`` flag. This is often desired if you want to train a pattern model on all the joined data::

	$ colibri-classencode -o out -u yourcorpus1 yourcorpus2

This will produce ``out.colibri.dat`` and ``out.colibri.cls``.


If you want to specify a large number of files, you can use the ``-l`` flag and specify a filename from which all input filenames will be read, one per line.

Class-decoding your corpus
------------------------------

Given an encoded corpus and a class file, the original corpus can always be reconstructed. This we call *class decoding* and is done using the ``colibri-classdecode`` program::
   
 $ colibri-classdecode -f yourcorpus.colibri.dat -c yourcorpus.colibri.cls

Partial decoding can be done by specifying start and end line numbers using the
flags ``-s`` and ``-e`` respectively.

Output will be to ``stdout``, you can redirect it to a file as follows::

 $ colibri-classdecode -f yourcorpus.colibri.dat -c yourcorpus.colibri.cls > yourcorpus.txt

.. _classencodetraintest:
Class-encoding with existing classes
----------------------------------------

Sometimes you want to encode new data using the same classes already used for another data set. For instance when comparing corpora, it is vital that the same classes are used, i.e. that identical words are assigned identical numerical classes. This also applies when you are working with a training set and a separate test set, or are otherwise interested in a comparative analysis between two comparable datasets. The initial class file is built on the training set, and it can be reused to encode the test set:

You can encode a dataset, here named ``testset.txt`` using an existing class file, ``trainset.colibri.cls``, as follows::

   $ colibri-classencode -f testset.txt -c trainset.colibri.cls 

This will result in an encoded corpus ``testset.colibri.dat`` and an *extended* class file ``testset.colibri.cls``, which is a superset of the original ``trainset.cls``, adding only those classes that did not yet exist in the training data.


Pattern Modeller
===============================

Introduction
-----------------------

The ``colibri-patternmodeller`` program is used to create pattern models capturing recurring patterns from a monolingual corpus. The extracted patterns are n-grams or skip-grams, where a skip-gram is an n-gram with one or more gaps of either a predefined size, thus containing unspecified or wildcard tokens, or of dynamic width.

In the internal pattern representation, in the place of the size marker, byte
value 128 is used for a fixed gap of a single token, and can be repeated for
gaps of longer length, byte value 129 is used for a gap of unspecified dynamic
width. 

The pattern finding algorithm is iterative in nature and is guaranteed to find
all n-grams above a specified occurrence threshold and optionally given a
maximum size for n. It does so by iterating over the corpus n times, iterating
over all possible values for n in ascending order. At each iteration, a sliding
window extracts all n-grams in the corpus for the size is question. An n-gram
is counted in a hashmap data structure only if both n-1-grams it by definition
contains are found during the previous iteration with an occurrence above the
set threshold.  The exception are unigrams, which are all by definition counted
if they reach the threshold, as they are already atomic in nature. At the end
of each iteration, n-grams not making the occurrence threshold are
pruned. This simple iterative technique reduces the memory footprint compared
to the more naive approach of immediately storing all in a hashmap, as it
prevents the storing of lots of patterns not making the threshold by discarding
them at an earlier stage. 

At the beginning of each iteration of n, all possible ways in which any n-gram
of size n can contain gaps is computed. When an n-gram is found, various
skip-grams are tried in accordance with these gap configurations. This is
accomplished by 'punching holes' in the n-gram, resulting in a skip-gram. If
all consecutive parts of this skip-gram were counted during previous iterations
and thus made the threshold, then the skip-gram as a whole is counted,
otherwise it is discarded. After each iteration, pruning again takes places to
prune skip-grams that are not frequent enough.

The pattern finder can create either indexed or unindexed models. For indexed
models, the precise location of where an n-gram or skipgram instance was found
in the corpus is recorded. This comes at the cost of much higher memory usage,
but is necessary for more strongly constrained skip extraction, as well as for
extracting relations between patterns at a later stage. Indexed models by
default also maintain a reverse index allowing, and even unindexed models do so
during building.

Note that for fixed-size skipgrams in indexed models, the various fillings
for the gaps can be reconstructed precisely.

If you are only interested in simple n-gram or simple skip-gram counts, then an
unindexed model may suffice. 

Creating a pattern model
----------------------------

First make sure to have class-encoded your corpus. Given this encoded corpus, ``colibri-patternmodeller`` can be invoked to produce an indexed pattern model. The occurrence threshold is specified with parameter ``-t``, patterns occuring less will not be counted. The default value is two.  The maximum value for n, i.e. the maximum n-gram/skipgram size, can be restricted using the parameter ``-l``.:: 

	$ colibri-patternmodeller -f yourcorpus.dat -t 10 
	
This will result in a pattern model ``yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri``. This model is stored in a binary format. To print it into a human readable presentation it needs to be decoded. The ``colibri-patternmodeller`` program can do this by specifying an input model using the ``-i`` flag, the class file using the ``-c`` parameter, and the desired action to print it all using ``-P``::

	$ colibri-patternmodeller -i yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.colibri.cls -P
	
Output will be to ``stdout`` in a tab delimited format, with the first line reserved for the header. This facilitates easy parsing as you can just load it into any software accepting CSV files, such as spreadsheets. An excerpt follows::

    PATTERN	COUNT	SIZE	TOKENS	COVERAGE	CATEGORY    REFERENCES
    With	2	1	2	0.0059	1	21:0 32:0
    or	4	1	4	0.0118	1	1:2 36:2 37:2 38:2
    To die	2	2	4	0.0118	1	5:7 9:5
    to be	2	2	4	0.0118	1	1:4 9:1
    is	2	1	2	0.0059	1	1:8 8:2

The various columns are:

* **Pattern** - The actual pattern. Gaps in skipgrams are represented as ``{*x*}`` where x is a number representing the size of the skip. Variable-width skipgrams are just ``{*}``. 
* **Occurrence count** - The absolute number of times this pattern occurs
* **Size** - The length of the n-gram or skipgram in words.
* **Tokens** - The absolute number of tokens in the corpus that this pattern covers. Computed as ``occurrencecount * n``. 
* **Coverage** - The number of covered tokens, as a fraction of the total number of tokens.
* **Category** - 1 for ngrams, 2 for fixed-width skipgrams, 3 for variable-width skipgrams.
* **References** - A space-delimited list of indices in the corpus that correspond to a occurrence of this pattern. Indices are in the form ``sentence:token`` where sentence starts at one and token starts at zero. This column is only available for indexed models.
 
The pattern model created in the previous example did not yet include skip-grams, these have to be explicitly enabled with the ``-s`` flag. When this is used, another options becomes available for consideration:

* ``-T [value]`` - Only skipgrams that have at least this many different types
  as skip content, i.e. possible options filling the gaps, will be considered.
  The default is set to two.
  
Here is an example of generating an indexed pattern model including skipgrams::

	$ colibri-patternmodeller -f yourcorpus.colibri.dat -t 10 -s -T 3

If you want to generate unindexed models, simply add the flag ``-u``. Do note that for unindexed models the parameter ``-T`` has no effect, it will extract all skipgrams it can find as if ``-T`` were set to one! If you want decent skpigrams, you're best off with an indexed model. Note that indexed models can always be read and printed in an unindexed way (with the ``-u`` flag); but unindexed models can not be read in an indexed way, as they simply lack indices::

	$ colibri-patternmodeller -d yourcorpus.unindexedpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.cls -u 
	$ colibri-patternmodeller -d yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.cls -u 


Statistical reports and histograms
----------------------------------

If you have a pattern model, you can generate a simple statistical report which includes information on the number of occurrences and number of types for patterns, grouped for n-grams or skipgrams for a specific value of *n*. A report is generated using the ``-R`` flag::

	   $ patternfinder -d yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -R
	   
	   EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
	   
	    REPORT

		N-grams:                      1245756     78261
		 n=1                           603046     10321
		 n=2                           400409     31734
		 n=3                           161613     22529
		 n=4                            51499      8522
		 n=5                            17219      3027
		 n=6                             6666      1209
		 n=7                             3325       575
		 n=8                             1979       344
 
A histogram can also be generated, using the ``-H`` flag.

Training and testing coverage
--------------------------------

An important quality of pattern models lies in the fact that pattern models can be compared. More specifically, you can train a pattern model on a corpus and test it on another corpus, which yields another pattern model containing only those patterns that occur in both training and test data. The difference in count, frequency and coverage can then be easily be compared.

Make sure to use the same class file for all datasets you are comparing. Instructions for this were given in :ref:`classencodetraintest`::
  
   $ patternfinder -f trainset.clsenc -t 10 -s -B -E
   $ patternfinder -d trainset.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -f testset.clsenc -t 10 -s -B -E
 
This results in a model ``testset.colibri.indexedpatternmodel``. This model can be used to generate a coverage report using the ``-C`` flag::

   $ patternfinder -d yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -C

The coverage report shows the number of tokens covered by n-grams or skipgrams, split down in different categories for each *n*. The *coverage* column expresses this value as a fraction of the total number of tokens in the corpus. It shows how much of the test set is covered by the training set. The *types* column expresses how many unique patterns exist in the category. The *count* columns expresses the absolute occurrence count and the *frequency* column expresses the over-all frequency. The fact that the occurrence count can be higher than the absolute number of tokens covered is due to the fact that n-grams and skipgrams inherently show considerable overlap when grouped together. 


A coverage report can be generated for any *indexed* pattern model; including models not generated on a separate test set.


Query mode
--------------

The pattern finder has query mode which allows you to quickly extract patterns from test sentences or fragments thereof. The query mode is invoked by loading a pattern model (``-d``), a class file (``-c``) and the ``-Q`` flag. The query mode can be run interactively as it takes input from ``stdin``, one *tokenised* sentence per line. The following example illustrates this, the sentence *"This is a test ."* was typed as input::

	$ patternfinder -d europarl25k-en.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -c europarl25k-en.cls -Q                                                        
	Loading model
	Loading class decoder europarl25k-en.cls
	Loading class encoder europarl25k-en.cls
	Starting query mode:
	1>> This is a test .
	1:0	This	1085	0.001593135275538986
	1:0	This is	395	0.001159978679885529

	1:0	This {*1*} a	66	0.0002907288336928288
	1:1	is	10570	0.0155202210713798
	1:1	is a	947	0.002781012176839484

	1:4	.	23775	0.03490948495478285

The output starts with an index in the format ``sentence:token``, the pattern found, and the next two values are the absolute occurrence count and the coverage ratio.

Graph Models
===================

Introduction
---------------------

A pattern model contains a wide variety of patterns; a graph model goes a step further by making explicit relationships between the various patterns in this model. These relationships can be visualised as a directed graph, in which the nodes represent the various patterns (n-grams and skipgrams), and the edges represent the relations. The following relations are distinguished; note that as the graph is directed relations often come in pairs; one relationship for each direction: 

* **Subsumption relations** - Patterns that are subsumed by larger patterns are called *children*, the larger patterns are called *parents*. These are the two subsumption relations that can be extracted from an indexed pattern model.
* **Successor relations**  - If a pattern A and a pattern B form part of a combined pattern A B, then the two patterns are in a successor/predecessor relationship.
* **Template relations** - Template relations indicate abstraction and go from n-grams to skipgrams. An example of a template relation is ``to be or not to be`` to ``to be {*1*} not {*1*} be``. The reverse direction is called the instance-relationship, as an specific n-gram is an instance of a more abstract template.
* **Skip content relations** - Relations between patterns that can be used to fill the gaps of higher patterns are called skip content relations. These can go in two directions; skipgram to skip content and skip content to skipgram. Example: ``to`` is a in a skip-content to skipgram relationship with  ``to be {*1*} not {*1*} be``.

In addition to the relations, a graph model can also compute a so-called *exclusivity count* and *exclusivity ratio* for each pattern. The exclusivity count of a pattern is the number of times the pattern occurs in the data *without* being subsumed by a larger found pattern. This exclusivity ratio is the exclusivity count as a fraction of the total occurrence count for the pattern. An exclusivity ratio of one indicates that the pattern is fully exclusive, meaning it is not subsumed by higher-order patterns. This notion of exclusivity may be of use in assessing compositionality of patterns. 


Computing a graph model
------------------------

The ``grapher`` program computes a graph model on the basis of an **indexed** pattern model created with ``patternfinder``. When computing a model, you need to explicitly specify which relations you desire to extract and include in your model. The more relations you include, the more memory will be required. To keep the models as small as possible, it is recommended to include only the relations you need. The following flags are available:

*	``-P`` - Compute/load subsumption relations from children to parents (reverse of -C)
*	``-C`` - Compute/load subsumption relations from parents to children (reverse of -P)
*	``-S`` - Compute/load skipgram to skipcontent relations
*	``-s`` - Compute/load skip-content to skipgram relations (reverse of -S)
*	``-L`` - Compute/load predecessor relations (constructions to the left)
*	``-R`` - Compute/load sucessor relations (constructions to the right)
*	``-T`` - Compute/load template relations
*	``-I`` - Compute/load instance relations (reverse of -T)
*	``-a`` - Compute/load all relations
*   ``-X`` - Compute/load count/ratios

The indexed pattern model that acts as input is specified using the ``-f`` flag. The following example generates a graph model with all relations::

	$ grapher -f yourcorpus.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -a
 
The graph model will be stored in binary form, in the file ``yourcorpus.graphpatternmodel.colibri``. 

Viewing and querying a graph model
------------------------------------

To decode this binary graph model into human readable form, read it in using the ``-d`` flag and pass a class file. In addition, you again need to pass what relations you want to load, as it is also possible to only load a subset of the relations. Simply use the ``-a`` flag if you want to load and output relations existing in the model::

  $ grapher -d yourcorpus.graphpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.cls -a

This will result in output to ``stdout`` in a tab-separated format, as illustrated below::

Outputting the whole graph may however produce a lot of unwanted output. Often you want to query your graph model for only one pattern. This is done with the ``-q`` parameter. In the following example we query our model for the pattern "summer"::

	$ grapher -d yourcorpus.graphpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.cls -a -q "summer"

	Outputting graph for "summer"

It is possible to actually visualise the graph, ``grapher`` can output to the so-called dot-format used by the open-source graph visualisation software `graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org>`_. You can output to this format by specifying the ``-G`` flag. This works both with and without ``-q``, but if you do not specify a query the graph may turn out to be too huge to visualise::

	$ grapher -d yourcorpus.graphpatternmodel.colibri -c yourcorpus.cls -a -q "summer" -G > summer.dot
 
Graphviz will do the actual conversion to an image file, such as png::
 
	$ dot -Tpng summer.dot -o summer.png
 
This generated the following image:

Alignment Models
=====================

Introduction
--------------

An alignment model establishes a translation from patterns in one model to patterns in another. Each alignment has an associated score, or a vector of multiple scores, expressing the quality of the alignment. Alignments can currently be computed in three ways, all of which are unsupervised methods, and the of which the last method is the superior one:

* **Co-occurrence (Jaccard)** - Alignments are established according to simple Jaccard co-occurrence
* **Expectation Maximisation** - Alignments between patterns are computed in a fashion similar to IBM Model 1, using Expectation Maximisation. Computation proceeds over the matrix of all patterns, rather than a matrix of mere words as in IBM Model 1. 
* **GIZA Word Alignments** - Alignments are established on the basis of word-alignments computed with ``GIZA++``.

The pattern models have to be generated on the basis of a parallel corpus. For colibri a parallel corpus consists of two corpus files, one for each language. The sentences on the n-th line of each of the  corpus files corresponds and should be translations of each other. Pattern and graph models can then be generated separately on both of these corpora. An indexed pattern model, or derived graph model, is required as input for the ``aligner`` program.

Co-occurrence
---------------------

Alignments computed solely on the basis of sentence co-occurrence are fairly weak. For all patterns that co-occur in at least one sentence, a Jaccard co-occurrence score is computed as :math:`\frac{|s \cap t|}{|s \cup t|}`, where *s* and *t* are sets of sentence numbers in which the pattern occurs. 

In the following example we translate French to English and assume pattern models have been computed already. Invoke the ``aligner`` program as follows, the ``-J`` flag chooses Jaccard co-occurrence::

	$ aligner -s fr.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -t en.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -J
 
This will result in an output file ``alignmodel.colibri``, which is in a binary format. If you want an alternative output filename you can specify it using the ``-o`` parameter.

Several other parameters adjust the behaviour of the alignment algorithm and output:

* ``-p [n]`` - Pruning value. Alignments with co-occurrence scores lower than *n* will be pruned (prior to any normalisation)
* ``-z`` - Disable normalisation. By default, the aligner will normalise all scores, if you want to retain the exact co-occurrence scores, pass this flag
* ``-b [n]`` - Best alignments only. Only the best *n* target alignments for a source pattern will be retained, others are pruned.
* ``-N`` - Do not attempt to directly align any skipgrams
 
Expectation Maximisation
----------------------------

This is an experimental method for computing alignments *directly* on the basis of the patterns. It is modelled after IBM Model 1 and uses the Expectation Maximisation algorithm to iteratively optimise the model's parameters.  The pseudo-code for the EM algorithm applied to this model is as follows:

.. code-block:: python

   initialize t(t|s) uniformly
   do until convergence
   	  set count(t|s) to 0 for all t,s
  	  set total(s) to 0 for all s
      for all sentence pairs (t_s,s_s)
         set total_s(t) = 0 for all t
         for all patterns t in t_s
            for all patterns s in s_s
              total_s(t) += t(t|s)
         for all patterns t in t_s
             for all patterns s in s_s
                count(t|s) += t(t|s) / total_s(t)
                total(s)   += t(t|s) / total_s(t)
      for all s
     	for all t
           t(t|s) = count(t|s) / total(s)

In the following example we translate French to English and assume pattern models have been computed already. Invoke the ``aligner`` program as follows, the ``-E`` flag chooses Expectation Maximisation::

	$ aligner -s fr.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -t en.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -E

This will result in an output file ``alignmodel.colibri``, which is in a binary format. If you want an alternative output filename you can specify it using the ``-o`` parameter. 

Several other parameters adjust the behaviour of the EM alignment algorithm and output:

* ``-P [n]`` - Probability pruning value. Alignments with a probability lower than *n* will be pruned
* ``-M [n]`` - Maximum number of iterations (default: 10000)
* ``-v [n]`` - Minimum delta-value when convergence is considered to have been reached (default: 0.001)
* ``-z`` - Disable normalisation. By default, the aligner will normalise all scores, if you want to retain the exact co-occurrence scores, pass this flag
* ``-b [n]`` - Best alignments only. Only the best *n* target alignments for a source pattern will be retained, others are pruned.
* ``-N`` - Do not attempt to directly align any skipgrams, skipgrams tend to worsen alignment quality significantly.
* ``--null`` - Take into account zero-fertility words in EM
* ``-I 1`` - Compute bi-directional alignments and use one joint score. This will run the algorithm twice, once for each direction, and compute the intersection of the results.
* ``-I 2`` - Compute bi-directional alignments and use two separate scores, representing p(t|s) and p(s|t). This will run the algorithm twice, once for each direction, and compute the intersection of the results.

Instead of uniform initiatisation, this method can also be initialised using the co-occurrence method laid out in the previous section. Simply add the ``-J`` parameter to achieve this.

GIZA Alignment
-----------------

``GIZA++`` is open-source software for the computation of word alignment models according to the IBM Models and HMM models (see `GIZA++ <http://code.google.com/p/giza-pp/>`_) [OchNey2003]_ . The ``aligner`` program can use the models produced by GIZA++ and extract aligned pairs of phrases. Two GIZA models (``*.A3.final``) are required, one for each translation direction. The extraction algorithm iterates over all sentence pairs in the GIZA models, these sentence pairs contain information in the form of what word-index of the source sentence is aligned to what word-index of the target sentence, and vice versa for the reverse model. Given such a bidirectional pair of alignments, the algorithm first collects all relevant patterns and for each possible combination it computes whether the word-alignment indices from the GIZA models support the alignment of the patterns.  The criteria for whether an alignment between patterns is supported by the word alignments are:

* Is the first word of the source pattern properly aligned according to the bidirectional intersection of the word alignments?
* Is the last word of the source pattern properly aligned according to the bidirectional intersection of the word alignments?
* Is the first word of the target pattern properly aligned according to the bidirectional intersection of the word alignments?
* Is the last word of the target pattern properly aligned according to the bidirectional intersection of the word alignments?
* Are none of the source words aligned to target words outside the target pattern?
* Are none of the target words aligned to source words outside the source pattern?

Of all target patterns (if any) meeting this criteria for a given source pattern, only the strongest one is chosen. An alignment strength score is computed to represent how well an alignment is supported by word alignments. This is not to be confused with the actual alignment probability. This score is the number of words that aligns properly, as a fraction of the longest pattern size of the pair. Only alignments that reach a certain threshold will be aligned. If the score is not perfect (< 0), points from the union of the two word alignment directions will be considered and added to the score as well, however, these alignments carry less weight than intersection alignments (four times less by default). 

This extraction algorithm is implemented as follows, given word alignments for source-to-target (``sentence_s``) and target-to-source (``sentence_t``):

.. code-block:: python

    patterns_t = all patterns in sentence_t           
    for all words word_s in sentence_s:
        patterns_s = find patterns BEGINNING WITH word_s
        for all patterns pattern_s in patterns_s:
            bestscore = 0
            for all patterns pattern_t in patterns_t:
                aligned = 0
                halfaligned = 0
                firstsourcealigned = false
                lastsourcealigned = false
                firsttargetaligned = false
                lasttargetaligned = false
                for for all indices (alignedsourceindex, alignedtargetindex) in intersection:
                    if alignedsourceindex not in pattern_s or alignedtargetindex not in pattern_t:
                        aligned--; break;
                    else:
                        aligned++;
                        if alignedsourceindex == sourceindex: firstsourcealigned = true
                        if alignedsourceindex == sourceindex + patternsize_s: lastsourcealigned = true
                        if alignedtargetindex == targetindex: firstsourcealigned = true
                        if alignedtargetindex == targetindex + patternsize_t: lastsourcealigned = true
                                                  
                        
                if ((aligned < 0) || (!firstaligned) || (!lastaligned)) break;
                
                maxpatternsize = max(|pattern_s|,|pattern_t|)
                score = aligned / maxpatternsize
                
                if (score < 1):
                    for alignedsourceindex, alignedtargetindex in union:                            
                        if (alignedsourceindex in pattern_s and alignedtargetindex not in pattern_t) or (alignedsourceindex not in pattern_s and alignedtargetindex in pattern_t):
                            halfaligned++;
                    if halfaligned:
                        score = score + halfaligned / (maxpatternsize*4)
                        if (score > 1) score = 1

               if score > bestscore:
                    bestscore = score
                    bestpattern_t = pattern_t                            
           
           
In the following example we translate French to English and assume pattern models have been computed already. Invoke the ``aligner`` program as follows, the ``-W`` flag chooses GIZA extraction and takes as parameters the two GIZA ``A3.final`` models (order matters!) separated by a colon. It is also necessary to pass the class the class file for both source (``-S``) and target language (``-T``), as the GIZA models do not use the colibri class encodings and thus need to be interpreted on the fly::

	$ aligner -s fr.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -t en.indexedpatternmodel.colibri -W fr-en.A3.final:en-fr.A3.final -S fr.cls -T en.cls

Several other parameters adjust the behaviour of the EM alignment algorithm and output:

* ``-a [n]`` - Alignment strength, value between 0 and 1. Determines how strong word alignments have to be if phrases are to be extracted, weak alignments will not be considered.
* ``-p [n]``-  Prune all alignments with a jaccard co-occurence score lower than specified (0 <= x <= 1). Uses heuristics to prune, final probabilities may turn out lower than they would otherwise be
* ``-c [n]`` - Prune phrase pairs that occur less than specified, here *n* is an integer representing the absolute count required for the phrase pair as a whole.
* ``-I 1`` - Compute bi-directional alignments and use one joint score. This does *not* run the algorithm twice, but is directly integrated.
* ``-I 2`` - Compute bi-directional alignments and use two separate scores, representing p(t|s) and p(s|t). This does *not* run the algorithm twice, but is directly integrated.

This alignment method replaces unsupervised word alignment symmetrisations heuristics like ``grow-diag``, ``grow-diag-final`` [OchNey2003].  

Skipgram alignment
----------------------

The alignment of skipgrams poses extra challenges. The three above alignment methods function much worse as soon as skipgrams are included. Therefore, an experimental alignment algorithm has been implemented to extract skipgrams on the basis of a graph model with instance and template relations. The algorithm starts with the n-grams that have been aligned by any of the three aforementioned algorithms, it then determines whether multiple target n-grams for a given source n-gram share a common template (i.e. a skip-gram that is an abstraction of a pattern). The template relation is a transitive relation, so recursion is applied to collect all possible templates, these can subsequently be clustered in one or more clusters, each cluster being completely independent of the other, not sharing any template or instance relationships. From each cluster only the best match, according to Jaccard co-occurrence is selected and aligned to the template(s) of the source pattern. This results in skipgram to skipgram alignments. N-gram to skipgram or skipgram to n-gram alignments are not supported by this method.

The algorithm is implemented as illustrated by the following pseudo-code:

.. code-block:: python

     for ngram_s in alignmatrix:
        if |alignmatrix[ngram_s]| > 1: #(nothing to generalise otherwise)
            skipgrams_s = get_templates_recursively(rel_templates_s[ngram_s])
            if skipgrams_s:            
                for ngram_t in alignmatrix[ngram_s]
                    skipgrams_t = get_templates_recursively(rel_templates_t[ngram_t])
                    if skipgrams_t:
                        for skipgram_s in skipgrams_s:
                            for skipgram_t in skipgrams_t:
                                submatrix[skipgram_s][skipgram_t]++
    prune all 1-values in submatrix                     
       
    for skipgram_s in submatrix: #conflict resolution
        if |submatrix[skipgram_s]| == 1:
            skipgram_t = first and only
            alignmatrix[skipgram_s][skipgram_t] = submatrix[skipgram_s][skipgram_t]
        else:                                
            clusters = get_independent_cluster(skipgrams_t) #complete subgraphs
            for cluster in clusters:
              maxcooc = 0
              for skipgram_t in cluster:
                if cooc(skipgram_s, skipgram_t) > maxcooc:
                    maxcooc = _
                    best = skipgram_t
                elif   == maxcooc:
                   if skipgram_t more abstract than best:
                        best = skipgram_t
              if best:
                 alignmatrix[skipgram_s][best] = submatrix[skipgram_s][best]                      
 

The following example takes an alignment model computed with only n-grams according to one of the three methods outlined earlier. It outputs a new alignment model, a superset of the original one, that adds the skipgram relations. The ``-U`` flag activates the skipgram extraction algorithm. Make sure to use the ``-o`` parameter to output a new model to a new file::
    
	$ aligner -U -d europarl25k-nl-en.alignmodel.colibri -o europarl25k-nl-en-withskipgrams.alignmodel.colibri 
 
Viewing an alignment model
----------------------------

An alignment model can be viewed by decoding it using the ``-d`` option and by passing it the class file for both source (``-S``) and target language (``-T``)::

	$ aligner -d alignmodel.colibri -S fr.cls -T en.cls
 
The output format is a simple tab-delimited format.

An alignment model can also be outputted in a format suitable for the MT decoder *moses* [Koehn2007]_::

	$ aligner -d alignmodel.colibri -S fr.cls -T en.cls --moses

A good translation should faithfully convey the meaning of the original, and it should be rendered in fluent natural language. In statistical machine translation, these two aspects are represented by two distinct statistical models. The translation model is used to compute the likelihood of a sentence being faithful to the original meaning, and the target language model imposes a maximally fluent natural word order on the resulting translation in the target language by scoring typical, predictable word order as more probable than uncommon or malformed combinations. The central processing component of an SMT system is the decoder, which computes probabilities according to at least these two models for a huge number of possible translation hypotheses. This constitutes a vast search problem in which countless hypotheses are tested and compete against one another for the best probability score according to the joint statistical models. The translation chosen is the hypothesis found to attain the best score. Due to the size and complexity of the search problem, and the need to keep time and memory requirements manageable, considerable pruning of the search takes place. It is quite possible that the selected translation is found in a local maximum.

Colibri features a custom-tailored MT decoder modelled after the stack-based decoding principle used in Moses [Koehn2003]_. This algorithm employs a beam search as a means to constrain the search space. The alignment model as discussed in the previous chapter provide the translation model. The mandatory language model can be computed with third-party software such as `SRILM <http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/>`_ [Stolcke2002]_ .

The stack decoder maintains *n* separate stacks, the number of stacks equals the number of words in the *source* sentence. Each stack contains translation hypotheses that cover an arbitrary *n* words of the source sentence. Only a fixed number of the best translation hypotheses are retained, this is the *stack size*. In the decoding process proceeds iteratively, starting with an *empty hypothesis* for which no source words have been covered and thus no target words have been generated. This initial hypotheses is *expanded* by choosing each input pattern matching the source sentence, at any position, and translating it according to the translation model. The translations are added left-to-right, but the selected source are from any location. This makes reordering possible. This expansions in turn results in a larger number of new translation hypotheses which are added to the appropriate stacks. After the initial hypothesis, the first stack is processed top to bottom, expanding in turn each of the hypotheses in it, resulting in more hypotheses to be added to the higher stacks. When a stack is processed, the algorithm moves on to the next. The final stack will be the stack in which all source words are covered and thus in which the hypotheses represent translations of the whole sentence. The best one is selected as the translation. 

The pseudo-code for the algorithm is as follows (from `Moses Background <http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.Background>`_) [Koehn2007]_::

	 initialize hypothesisStack[0 .. nf];
	 create initial hypothesis hyp_init;
	 add to stack hypothesisStack[0];
	 for i=0 to nf-1:
	   for each hyp in hypothesisStack[i]:
		 for each new_hyp that can be derived from hyp:
		   nf[new_hyp] = number of foreign words covered by new_hyp;
		   add new_hyp to hypothesisStack[nf[new_hyp]];
		   prune hypothesisStack[nf[new_hyp]];
	 find best hypothesis best_hyp in hypothesisStack[nf];
	 output best path that leads to best_hyp;

The website `Moses Background <http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.Background>`_ provides more detail about this algorithm. The algorithm implemented in colibri is identical, although hypothesis recombination is not implemented yet in the Colibi decoder. 

The colibri decoder has been enhanced to be able to handle skipgrams. Source-side skipgrams need no special handling due to the stack-based nature that already supports it; translations with gaps however do need special attention. The colibri decoder solves this by introducing a second set of another *n* stacks for hypotheses containing gaps. The expansion operation for hypotheses in these stacks attempts explicitly seeks to fill one of gaps first, the expanded hypotheses will again form part of the normal *gapless* stacks once all gaps are filled. 

Unlike Moses, the colibri decoder also integrates support for classifiers. This will be introduced in the next chapter.

Language Model
-----------------

As a Language Model is a vital component of a machine translation system, here are instructions on how to generate a language model using `SRILM <http://www.speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/>`_ [Stolcke 2002]_. The language model should be generated for only the target language corpus::

	$ ngram-count -kndiscount -order 3 -unk -text yourtargetcorpus.txt -lm yourtargetcorpus.lm

The above command generates a trigram model (``-order 3``) with (modified) Knesser Ney discounting (``-kndiscount``), it includes supports for unknown words (``-unk``). Support for unknown words and back-off are requirements for the colibri decoder. The final argument specifies the output file for the language model, this can in turn be read by the colibri decoder.

Note that as this is external softare, you need to pass the *tokenised* corpus in plain-text format, not the class-encoded binary variant used by colibri. But do make sure both are generated on exactly the same data. 

Decoder Usage
-----------------

The colibri decoder requires at least an alignment model (also known as translation model), and a language model. The translation model may contain multiple scores. The final score for an hypothesis is a weighted log-linear combination of all components model, in which each model carries a weight. These weights are passed as parameters to the decoder. The ``-W`` argument specifies weights for the scores in the alignment model, it should be repeated for the amount of scores in a model. The ``-L`` argument sets the weight for the language model, ``-D`` does the same for the distortion model (both default to one). The following example shows how to invoke the decoder given a translation model (``-t``) and language model (``-l``). It is also necessary to specify the class file for both source (``-S``) and (``-T``) target::

	$ decoder -t alignmodel.colibri -l yourtargetcorpus.lm -S yoursourcecorpus.cls -T yourtargetcorpus.cls -W 1 -W 1 < inputfile.txt
	
The decoder reads its input from ``stdin``, hence the `` < inputfile.txt``. The input should consist of tokenised sentences in the source language, one sentence per line. It will output the translation to ``stdout``, again one sentence per line. Extra information will be written to ``stderr``, the verbosity of which can be adjusted with the ``-v`` parameter.	 

The decoder takes the following extra parameters:

* ``-s`` - The stacksize (defaults to 100)
* ``-p`` - The prune threshold. The pruning threshold is a number between 0 and 1. It determines how much of a stack to prune based on the highest scoring hypothesis in the stack. If the prune threshold is set to for instance *0.8* then all hypotheses having a score of less than *80%* of the highest scoring hypothesis are pruned.
* ``-W n`` - Translation model weight. Issue this parameter multiple times if there are multiple scores in your alignment model (``-W 1 -W 1``). Alignment models generated with ``aligner -I 2`` generate two scores. If there is a mismatch between the number of scores specified here and in the alignment model, then an error will be raised.
* ``-L n`` - Language model weight.
* ``-D n`` - Distortion model weight.
* ``-N`` - Ignore and do not use skipgrams
* ``-M n`` -   Distortion limit. This corresponds to the maximum number of words a reordering displacement occurs over (default: unlimited). 

In addition, the following parameters control output and verbosity:

* ``-v n`` - Sets the verbosity value. *n* is a number from 0 to 5. Setting a high level will very explicitly show what the decoder is doing, be aware that this generates a huge amount of output to ``stderr``.
* ``--stats`` - Compute and output decoding statistics for each solution.
* ``--globalstats`` - Compute and output decoding statistics for all hypothesis accepted on a stack.
