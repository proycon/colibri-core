/// \mainpage Bz2 Stream Classes
/// bz2stream is a set of four classes making it easy to use the bz2
/// compression algorithm from C++.  The four classes are two stream
/// buffers -- one for compression and one for decompression -- and
/// two streams -- one for input and one for output.
///
/// The input stream uses the decompression stream buffer, and the
/// output stream uses the compression stream buffer; this makes it
/// possible to read from a bz2 input stream just as you would read
/// from std::cin or from a std::ifstream, and to write to a bz2
/// output stream just the way you would write to any other output
/// stream, like std::cout or a std::ofstream without worrying about
/// compression and decompression at all.
///
/// The streams do not write the data to any default destination, but
/// to another stream buffer.  This gives you the maximun possible
/// flexibility.  You just create a "normal" input or output stream,
/// and then use pass its stream buffer to the bz2 stream.  The bz2
/// stream acts as a filter, compressing or decompressing all the data
/// you pass it.
///
/// For example, to read a file, compress it and write it to another
/// file a program as the following would be enough:
/// \code
/// #include "bz2stream.hpp"
/// #include <iostream>
/// #include <fstream>
///
/// int main(int argc, char** argv) {
///     std::ifstream infile(argv[1], std::ios::binary);
///     std::ofstream outfile(argv[2], std::ios::binary);
///     bz2ostream out(outfile.rdbuf());
///     out << infile.rdbuf();
/// }
/// \endcode
///
/// The performance loss because of the use of the stream classes and
/// not of direct calls to libbzip2's API is virtually non existent.
/// This small program is as fast as bzip2.  There is a bit a more
/// extensive test program included in the archive.
///
/// Notice that the stream buffer you pass to the ::bz2istream or
/// ::bz2ostream constructor must be in binary mode, because the
/// compressed data is binary and the conversions which happen in text
/// mode will corrupt it.
///
/// The use of the bz2 stream classes is especially easy because there
/// are no libraries you need to link to; you only need to include the
/// bz2stream.hpp header.  (Of course you must link against libbz2).
///
/// Notice that this is an early release; this code is tested, but not
/// ready for applications where absolute reliability is a must.

/// \file bz2stream.hpp
/// This file declares and defines all of the bz2stream class set.  It
/// is currently the only source code file.
